                        answer:"We start with a discovery call to understand your pain points. Then our automation expert maps out what tasks to automate, designs the AI agent architecture, develops it custom for your workflow, tests thoroughly, and deploys it into your systems. You're involved at every step, no surprises."

                        answer: "It depends on complexity, but most AI automation agency projects start between $5,000-$15,000 for initial development. Monthly maintenance runs $500-$2,000. We provide transparent quotes upfrontâ€”no hidden fees. Think of it as hiring a full-time employee who never sleeps, never quits, and costs less annually."

                        answer: "Yes. We build AI automation service solutions that integrate with your existing CRM, scheduling tools, accounting software, and databases. No need to change what's working, we make it work smarter. If you use it daily, we can likely automate around it or enhance it."

                        answer: "Simple artificial intelligence automation takes 2-4 weeks. Complex multi-system integrations need 6-12 weeks. Rush projects possible for urgent needs. We give you realistic timelines during consultation, never overpromise. Most clients see their first automation running within 30 days of starting"
